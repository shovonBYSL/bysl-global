    "The advent of Industry 4.0 instrumentalizing automation in all aspects of manufacturing has simplified the communication and coordination of data along the value chain. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), on the other hand, enabled the manufacturers to harvest data and translate it into useful information. The manufacturing industry is now more dependent on the use of Big Data and connecting it to the physical operations of manufacturing using various sensors, applications and devices.",
  subTitle2:
    "Our relentless pace of innovation keeps our manufacturing partners on the forefront of technology. With cloud-based serverless digital architecture, an ecosystem of microservices and flexible costing strategy for our partners to realize digital transformation at every phase of the value chain, we open up new possibilities for solving complex design problems, running engineering simulations on cloud, achieving workflow automation in operations and supply chain and many more.",
